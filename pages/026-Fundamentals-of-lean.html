			<p class="text-darkGray">Lean is a management practice that delivers the highest quality at the lowest possible cost by eliminating all non-value added activities, or waste, in your processes. It is an enterprise-wide philosophy developed from the Toyota Production System that now has become successful in all industries. </p>

			<p class="text-darkGray">Lean is about doing “the right work” and doing it “right.” </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-darkGray">Though Lean has been misrepresented, misused, and misunderstood to the extent that one might ask, “Is Lean viable?”, when implemented in the right way, it greatly reduces delays, reduces costs, and improves quality — bringing maximum value to your customer. </p>

			<p class="text-darkGray">Ultimately the purpose of Lean is to give your customer what they want, when they want it, at the price they can afford while growing your own capacity to thrive as an organization.</p>
