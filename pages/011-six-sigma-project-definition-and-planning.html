    <p class="text-darkBlue">This one&ndash;day workshop will focus on what could be the most critical part of the Six Sigma journey; learning project deﬁnition and planning to create a smooth process from the very beginning. In this workshop students will focus their effort on a selected project and learn the following foundational tools of process success: deﬁning clear objectives, and writing a problem statement, a scope of work, the voice of the customer, and what represents a successful project conclusion. By the end of the day, the student will have a clear understanding of how to plan for success using thoughtful project deﬁnition and planning.</p>
