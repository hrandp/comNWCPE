			<p class="text-darkGray">This two-day Measurement System Analysis (MSA) course is essential for successful Six Sigma DMAIC and DFSS projects, the implementation of SPC and SQC, and effective process management. Reliable measurement processes are key to the success of any effort dependent on measurement data and process analysis, including Six Sigma DMAIC improvement projects, DFSS project, SPC, SQC, Supplier Quality, and business process management and continuous improvement. Without validation that measurements are accurate, repeatable with multiple measurements by the same person, reproducible from person to person (gage Repeatability and Reproducibility or gage R&R), all conclusions are suspect and process management is  therefore fragile and/or ineffective. Organizations typically focus on measurement accuracy and calibration, but this course also emphasizes the important elements of reliable measurement processes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-darkGray">Students learn how to assess and improve measurement processes with measurement system analysis (MSA), including how to set-up, conduct, and interpret gage R&R studies as well as develop control charts to maintain reliability. The methods are a powerful and practical guide to improving measurement processes. The course addresses measurement of continuous variables (e.g., distance, temperature, thickness) and attribute variables (e.g., number of error or defects, proportion defective). Participants also learn how to deal with non-destructive, semi-destructive, and destructive measurement processes.</p>
