			<p class="text-darkGray">The recognition of Six Sigma Yellow Belt, Green Belt, and Black Belt certification is worldwide. NWCPE Certification is a testimony to a person’s Six Sigma discipline and skill in achieving operational excellence. Six Sigma Yellow Belts understand how to recognize, define and contribute to customer focused process and product improvement opportunities. Six Sigma Green Belts are adept at the development of intermediate level problem-solving methods and lead teams to design and improve products and processes. Six Sigma Black Belts develop and lead teams in improvement projects requiring advanced technical and organizational skills, and can coach others in the effective application of Six Sigma methodologies.</p>

Six Sigma is analytical and enables improvement by offering strategy and methods to understand the cause and effect of processes. Lean is about the way an organization designs their processes. The central theme of Lean is the reduction of waste. Six Sigma reduces defects and errors by reducing the probability of any failure opportunity to occur while Lean reduces defects and errors by reducing the number of opportunities for failure.</p>
