			<p class="text-darkGray">Lean and Six Sigma are complementary methodologies with the common goal of operational excellence. Ultimately, Lean and Six Sigma need each other to realize that goal. Six Sigma is analytical and enables improvement by offering strategy and methods to understand the cause and effect of processes. Lean is about the way an organization designs their processes. The central theme of Lean is the reduction of waste. Six Sigma reduces defects and errors by reducing the probability of any failure opportunity to occur while Lean reduces defects and errors by reducing the number of opportunities for failure.</p>
