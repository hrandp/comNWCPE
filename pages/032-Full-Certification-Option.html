			<p class="text-darkGray">Certification is an important step toward success. By developing the expertise to plan and deploy lean in the right way you reduce your risk of failure, learn how to drive organizational change, and create best practices that can be shared across the organization. The certification option adds this 1.5 day course that teaches project leadership skills and ties them into the activities of the Lean Practitioner certificate courses (BE808, BE809, BE812, BE814, BE815, and BE815). Students develop the personal skills necessary to develop and lead a team in an improvement project. Students also plan and complete a project, receive coaching along the way, and, since presentation skills are a factor in successful project management, participants will make a final presentation to their fellow students.</p>
