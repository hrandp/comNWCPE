			<p class="text-darkGray">Value Stream Maps and process maps are the blueprints for improvement. But there is much more to these improvement projects than just mapping. Value Stream Management is a necessary tool if you plan to implement Lean. It not only identifies critical process areas needing change and the projects that will ensure that change – but also will create a picture of the future state, and the measures, Lean Pathway, and Project Plan to reach that ideal state.</p>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-darkGray">Case studies from the service and manufacturing industries will be used to show how to eliminate “the silo effect,” apply Value Stream Management and Continuous Flow to your organization. The workshop will focus on two main topics: Process mapping and process design.</p>
