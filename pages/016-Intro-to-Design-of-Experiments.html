			<p class="text-darkGray">This Introduction to Design of Experiments one and a half-day workshop will prepare students to unlock the secrets of cause and effect of processes and products through the design of two-level full factorial studies with variable and categorical data. Students will learn how to design an experiment, how to make sure it reveals what needs to be known. Discovering the sweet spots for important process outputs, how to define process windows, and how to look for opportunities to build-in robustness are areas of focus for this course. Participants will learn the underlying concepts important to assuring the design of effective experiments and how to assure the most efficient use of resources for running a designed experiment. The course provides plenty of hands-on opportunities to practice new skills in simulated and live processes to assure students walk away with new skills that can immediately be implemented in Six Sigma DMAIC or DFSS projects.</p>

	<div class="col-md-12">
		<p class="text-darkBlue"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> A basic understanding of statistics is preferable. Concepts such as histograms, distributions, mean and standard deviation, area under the normal curve, and the central limit theorem are helpful but will be reviewed in the course. Prior training in regression analysis and hypothesis testing isn’t required as we will teach the applicable principles as part of this course; however, they provide an excellent preparation.</p>
