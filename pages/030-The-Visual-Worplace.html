			<p class="text-darkGray">The Visual Workplace is used by many organizations to establish an efficient, safe, and ergonomic workplace. It also enables you to achieve adherence to standards and, ultimately, eliminates process errors, unneeded walking, searching, and waiting. Using better organization, visual communication, layout design, and a culture of self-discipline and teamwork, the Visual Workplace is a powerful system. However, many programs stall in as few as 6 months after initial implementation. This workshop will show you the finer points of implementing a successful Visual Workplace program that will transform the workplace — and succeed in the future. It is an experiential workshop where students learn the implementation skills needed to launch the system in their own workplace.</p>
