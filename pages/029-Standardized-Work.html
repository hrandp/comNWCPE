			<p class="text-darkGray">Standardized Work is one of the most powerful but least understood Lean tools. By developing and documenting the best practice to perform work, Standardized Work creates the foundation for training, Lean Daily Management, and continuous improvement. Standardized Work consists of four basic elements: Work rate, work sequence, point of use, and the relationship between worker, equipment, tools, and software. This course will teach students how to develop, document, and sustain Standardized Work.</p>
