			<p class="text-darkGray">Lean is a management practice that delivers the highest quality at the lowest possible cost by eliminating all non-value added activities, or waste, in your processes. It is an enterprise-wide philosophy developed from the Toyota Production System that now has become successful in all industries. </p>

			<p class="text-darkGray">Though Lean has been misrepresented, misused, and misunderstood to the extent that one might ask, “Is Lean viable?”, when implemented in the right way, it greatly reduces delays, reduces costs, and improves quality — bringing maximum value to your customer.</p>

			<p class="text-darkGray">Ultimately the purpose of Lean is to give your customer what they want, when they want it, at the price they can afford while growing your own capacity to thrive as an organization.</p>

The class must be taken as part of the Lean Practitioner series.</p>

			<h2 class="text-darkGray text-center">Lean Leadership Certification:</h2>

			<p class="text-darkGray">The Lean Leadership Certification course gives students the knowledge to introduce behavioral change and foster a continually improving, reduced-waste environment — especially for senior managers, supervisors, continuous improvement coordinators, and team leaders. The Lean philosophy, though developed and popularized by Toyota, has vastly expanded from manufacturing across all industries. Unlike our Lean Practitioner program, which is designed to provide the basic skills necessary to begin a Lean journey, the purpose of the Lean Leadership certificate is to go beyond those first steps so students learn to launch projects and make real change within their organizations.</p>
