    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p class="text-darkBlue">This two and a half days Intermediate Design of Experiments (DOE) workshop goes right to the heart of Six Sigma. Design of experiments is a microcosm of the complete Six Sigma DMAIC protocol in its quest for defining Y = f(x)). Students  will learn Design of Experiments protocol that aligns perfectly with Lean principles by emphasizing value&ndash;added process steps, allowing the experimenter to make informed decisions about the relative benefits of including lesser value-adding steps in the design and execution of experiments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p class="text-darkBlue">This workshop extends the teachings from the Six Sigma &mdash; Introduction to Design of Experiments (DOE). After a thorough review of basic Design of Experiment principles, students will learn how to design and analyze statistically sound studies for: 3+ factors and 3&plus; levels, with full and fractional factorial response surface designs to model linear and non-linear cause and effect relationships. Participants will learn effective approaches to design optimum and robust processes, and how to do so in the most efficient manner possible.</p>

On&ndash;site customized courses typically include, at the discretion of the client, the design and execution of live experiments on the customers chosen processes or products.</p>

          <p class="text-darkBlue"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> A basic understanding of statistics is preferable. This workshop on Intermediate Design of Experiments is a follow&ndash;up course from the Intro to Design of Experiments workshop (Six Sigma 505). However, as this workshop includes a thorough review of concepts and methods discussed in the Intro workshop, participants normally manage well even if they haven’t completed the intro workshop. On the other hand, for those who have completed the intro workshop, the review of concepts and methods serve as strong reinforcement of those principles and typically brings them to a significantly higher level of understanding and ability to apply them. Prior training in regression analysis and hypothesis testing isn’t required as we will teach the applicable principles as part of this course; however, they provide an excellent preparation.</p>
