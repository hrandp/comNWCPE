			<p class="text-darkBlue">Other areas of focus will be on how to define process windows and how to look for opportunities to build in robustness. Participants will learn the underlying concepts important to assuring the design of effective experiments and how to assure the most efficient use of resources for running a designed experiment. The course provides plenty of hands-on opportunities to practice in simulated and live processes to assure students walk away with new skills that can immediately be implemented in Six Sigma DMAIC or DFSS projects. </p>

			<p class="text-darkBlue">Design and Analysis of Experiments (DOE) are techniques used by designers to determine effects of variable factors that could affect desired output in any design. It helps pinpoint sensitive components and areas in the design that cause the most significant problems. DOE is the ultimate tool for increasing an understanding of cause and effect and applying that learning to design.</p>
			<p class="text-darkBlue">At the end of this first portion of the two-course series, participants will understand:</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12 text-darkBlue">
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li>How to design, run, analyze and interpret full and fractional two-level factorial designs in order to identify cause and effect and develop solutions to solve problems or improve processes and their outputs.</li>
				<li>Methods for dealing with non-linear cause and effect relationships.</li>
				<li>Strategies for accelerating the attainment of the study goals.</li>
				<li>How to exploit the DOE methodology to assure the effectiveness of day-to-day operations and improvement methods such as Lean and Six Sigma.</li>
				<li>Course reference materials and free post-workshop email and phone support for the design and analysis of designed experiments once you are back on-site.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="text-darkBlue"><strong>Note:</strong> Design Expert Software needs to be installed on your laptop for the course. It can be downloaded a free 45-day trial copy from Stat-Ease here: www.statease.com.</p>

			<h2>Additional Course notes:</h2>
			<p>A key objective and strategy with this workshop is that participants leave the workshop feeling comfortable and confident to return home and initiate their own DOE applications. The workshop covers 2-level full and factorial designs in-depth and will typically satisfy at least 75% to 90% of one’s needs for DOE. The workshop introduces the Responses Surface methodology for modeling non-linear cause and effect relationships. In-depth treatment of RSM designs is available in follow-up workshops on DOE.</p>
