			<p class="text-darkGray">People involved in Lean for any period of time inevitably discover Lean is always difficult to sustain and adhere to after initial implementation. A Lean culture is one in which Lean methods are being applied every day by every person to eliminate waste and continually improve. Lean success requires focus and discipline over an extended period of time. It also requires vision, leadership, and commitment by management. Finally, it requires a structured process for attaining and sustaining the awareness, attitudes, and skills for Lean success. That process is called Lean Daily Management and this course will give students the tools to launch Lean Daily Management, as well as the logic to sell it and sustain it.</p>
