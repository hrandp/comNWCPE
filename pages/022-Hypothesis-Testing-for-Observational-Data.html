			<p class="text-darkGray">This one and a half-day Hypothesis Testing for Observational Data workshop will enable students to answer multiple key questions. Has there been a change in process or product? Is this process or product different from this one? Is there a change in customer satisfaction from before to after the project completion? Are there differences in process cycle times or yields among the operations around the world? Ultimately, hypothesis testing are statistical methods to answer the fundamental question, “Does the data support a hypothesis that says there is a difference?”</p>
			<p class="text-darkGray">Hypothesis testing applies to Design of Experiments and “observational data”.</p>
		</div>
	

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-darkBlue">Whereas Design of Experiments refers to a plan designed to systematically manipulate factors (Xs) to understand if they have an effect on some dependent variable or variables (Ys) and model that effect, “observational data” refers to data derived from observations from processes or products where they was no systematic manipulation of causal factors (Xs).</p>

		 	<p class="text-darkGray">Medical research is an excellent example of this latter kind of observational data since it may be unethical to withhold treatment that could improve one’s medical condition or to apply treatment where there is risk that it could be harmful.</p>
