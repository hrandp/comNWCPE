			<p class="text-darkBlue">This one and a half days Systematic Problem Solving workshop is about learning proven methods that are the best for solving problems, and improving processes. This course explores the practical application of scientific methods, such as DMAIC, 8D, PDCA, and PDSA. Students learn about the Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC protocol for process improvement), the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) protocols, and how they relate to 8D, PDCA, and PDSA. With that foundation and perspective, students learn the systematic problem-solving tools that are fundamental to any process improve-ment. The methods taught in this course are helpful whether the ulti-mate goal is to apply Six Sigma, Lean, or Lean Six Sigma, Statistical Process Control (SPC), Statistical Quality Control (SQC), or to achieve world-class operational excellence.</p>
