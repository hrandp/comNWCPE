		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-darkGray">This two-day Statistical Process Control (SPC) workshop builds on the concepts from the Introduction to Statistical Methods workshop (SS502). This course teaches students the next level of methodologies that will increase their ability to account for differences in the nature of processes while also learning the best methods for managing their processes for control and continual improvement. As with the introductory course on statistical methods, this course is invaluable for Six Sigma DMAIC improvement projects and Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) projects, Lean Six Sigma implementations, Business Process Management, Quality Management, Supplier Quality Management, or Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Statistical Quality Control (SQC).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-darkGray">The quality of this course offering is one of the key differentiators between NWCPE’s certified Six Sigma Green Belt and Six Sigma Black Belt programs versus lesser valued Six Sigma instruction. Six Sigma certified Green Belts and Black Belts will become well equipped to manage basic and complex DFSS and DMAIC process improvement projects. Students will also leave this course with the SPC charts and SPC tools to manage and coach full statistical process control (SPC) and Statistical Quality (SQC) implementations, as well as the ability to manage business process analytics systems for world-class operational excellence.</p>
