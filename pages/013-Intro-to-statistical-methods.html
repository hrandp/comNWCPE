			<p class="text-darkGray">This two-day Introduction to Statistical Methods workshop is essential for those aspiring to certification as a Six Sigma Yellow Belt, Six Sigma Green Belt, or Six Sigma Black Belt, or those who will serve as Six Sigma Champions in organizations aspiring to operational excellence. This course also builds the foundation for all of the following courses in a Six Sigma or Lean Six Sigma certification path. The methods you will learn are fundamental to Six Sigma DMAIC improvement projects and Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) projects, Lean Six Sigma implementations, Business Process Management, Quality Management or Statistical Process Control (SPC), and Statistical Quality Control (SQC).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-darkGray">This course will teach effective process analysis, monitoring, management, and continuous improvement; essential methodologies to learn regardless of industry or how they are applied: medical device, semi-conductor, or wind turbine manufacturing; or improvement in servicing people in need through a hospital room or an IT service call. The methods learned in this course will reveal the process character and provide the foundation for solving and sustaining process improvement; which is the secret ingredient of all operational excellence.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<p class="text-darkGray">Participants will learn how to characterize process variation and behavior with histograms, box and whisker plots, normal distribution parameters, and basic statistical process control methods. They will also learn about individuals (Xi) and Moving Range (MR) control charts for variable data, as well as how to assess process capability (Cpk) and performance (Ppk) relative to requirements.</p>
